### 🤔 What's this repo about?

It will soon be a random collection of **CLI 🔧 TOOLS 🔧 and 🧪 EXPERIMENTS 🧪** that I want to build.
Currently it hosts my latest tool, but it will soon have tools I *previously developed in C* (during CS50x) re-made in *Python*, as well as some *new tools/games* I've been thinking about making.

👋 ***Thanks for checking it out!***
